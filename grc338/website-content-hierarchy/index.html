            <h3>To our Better Buzz community</h3>
            
            <p>From Escondido, to La Jolla and Hillcrest, we cannot thank each of the communities we serve you in enough. Thank you for continuing to get buzzed with us amid this incredibly demanding year. Thank you for wearing your mask, socially distancing and treating our team with respect, patience and kindness. Without your support, we would not be here, and it means the absolute world to us.</p>

            <p>A massive thank you to our baristas, greeters and managers — It goes without saying that the challenges presented this year shook each of us without exception. Staying true to our purpose as a company, our team continued to live the Buzz Life; to give, be and live at 100%, even in the face of adversity. We are truly blown away by their fortitude.</p>

            <p>Collectively, between our loyal customers and our incredible team, you’ve helped us remember why we started Better Buzz Coffee 19 years ago with a self-made four wheel coffee cart in a business park; to use coffee as a catalyst to motivate one another, inspire personal growth, and most importantly, to tap into the human potential needed to actively improve our communities — a “Better Buzz” if you will.</p>
