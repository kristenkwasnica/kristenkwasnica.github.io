            <p class="about-text">Hi! My name is Kristen Kwasnica and I'm a first year graphic communication student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and I am an aspiring UI/UX designer. I'm from Carlsbad, California, a small beach town in San Diego county. In my free time I enjoy playing soccer and volleyball, spending time with my friends and family, and being creative in forms such as making art, taking photographs, and editing videos.

            <img src="assets/images/wave1.jpg" alt="wave" height="500px" />
            <img src="assets/images/wave2.jpg" alt="wave" height="500px" />
            <img src="assets/images/wave3.jpg" alt="wave" height="500px" />
            <h4>Illustrator Project</h4><p class="body-text">I used the shaper tool to create the circles with various size and color and overlapped. I then used the paintbrush tool to begin adding the lines of the wave in strokes. I used the paintbrush tool and blob brush tool to add different shading and coloring to the wave. Then, I used the pen tool to then sharpen up the edges of the diamond so there would be sharp, crisp lines. </p>
              
            <img src="assets/images/postcard_01.jpg" alt="postcard front" height="300px" width="430px" />
            <img src="assets/images/postcard_02.jpg" alt="postcard back" height="300px" width="430px" />
            <h4>InDesign Postcard</h4><p class="body-text">This postcard is from my hometown, so I incorporated images I felt embodied what Carlsbad is all about. Since it is a beach town, I used two pictures of different beaches and also used an image of the flower fields, one of Carlsbad’s gems. On the back I wanted to keep it simple so I just added a few lines to give the postcard a pop of color and tied  the blue color into the stamp area and lines below. </p>
              
            <img src="assets/images/colormyworld_before.JPG" alt="colormyworld" width="430px"/>
            <img src="assets/images/colormyworld_after.jpg" alt=colormyworld width="430px" />
            <h4>Photoshop: Color Your World</h4> <p class="body-text">For this project I was assigned to change the color of two items and I wanted to specifically focus on the clothing. I created different layers for the different skirt edits and used the quick selection tool to grab cover the entirety of each skirt.  Then I made a hue/saturation mask on the adjustment layer and changed hue and saturation settings to replace the colors of the skirts.  </p>

            <h4>Photoshop: Skin Retouching</h4><p class="body-text">For each face in this photoshop series, I first used the patch tool to remove the large, noticeable blemishes. I used the patch tool to draw a circle around the blemishes and then used the cursor over the selected area and dragged to an area that I wanted to use as my source. In this case, an area without blemishes. I repeated this throughout the entire face. Next, I wanted to create a more even texture throughout the entirety of the face and I used the clone stamp tool. With the clone stamp tool, first you option-click to define the source, and option-control then drag cursor right to create bigger surface area of clone stamp. Then you simply position the cursor over the area where you want to paint the cloned pixels and then start painting by clicking on the area and repeat until satisfied. For the man, I used the patch tool and the clone stamp tool to clean up some of the eyebrow hairs and facial hair. For the last two pictures I liquified their faces by clicking filter then liquify to enhance certain facial features. </p>
